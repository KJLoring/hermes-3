Examples
========


1D flux-tube
------------

These simulations follow the dynamics of one or more species along the
magnetic field. By putting a source at one end of the domain, and a
sheath at the other, this can be a useful model of plasma dynamics in
the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) of a tokamak or other magnetised plasma.


2D drift-plane
--------------

Simulations where the dynamics along the magnetic field is not
included, or only included in a parameterised way as sources or
sinks. These are useful for the study of the basic physics of plasma
"blobs" / filaments, and tokamak edge turbulence.



2D axisymmetric tokamak
-----------------------

These are transport simulations, where the cross-field transport is given
by diffusion, and fluid-like equations are used for the parallel dynamics
(as in the 1D flux tube cases).
